# LSTM Stock Prediction

## Introduction
The outcome of this project is to utilize time series forecasting to analyze historical data of a particular stock to make predictions about its future price

## Technology Used
Python and Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

- Collect and preprocess historical stock price data.
- Explore data patterns using visualizations.
- Implement time series forecasting models.
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance.
- Generate predictions for stock prices.

## Dataset Information

Here is the dataset used for this project - https://github.com/Nam1707/LSTM-stock-prediction/blob/main/GOOG.csv

More info about dataset can be found here: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?p=GOOG

## Analysis
For this model, we are using stock market data from the last 5 years. This helps fine-tune our model better since tech stock has been skyrocketing over the last few years.
For the train validation test split, I put 80% of the data in the training set, 10% in the validation set, and 10% in the test set.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Nam1707/LSTM-stock-prediction.git`.

2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd LSTM-stock-prediction`.

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook (`stock_forecasting.ipynb`) to learn how to preprocess data, build forecasting models, and evaluate their performance.

5. Run the notebook to see the step-by-step process of analyzing historical data, building models, and generating predictions.

6. Customize the code and models according to your preferred stock and analysis criteria.
