# LSTM Stock Prediction

## Introduction
The outcome of this project is to utilize time series forecasting to analyze historical data of a particular stock to make predictions about its future price

## Technology Used
Python and Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Information

Here is the dataset used for this project - https://github.com/Nam1707/LSTM-stock-prediction/blob/main/GOOG.csv

## Analysis
For this model, we are using stock market data from the last 5 years. This helps fine-tune our model better since tech stock has been skyrocketing over the last few years.
For the train validation test split, I put 80% of the data in the training set, 10% in the validation set, and 10% in the test set.
